# hibernate

implementation of the above design using java/hibernate on Oracle 11g Express.  Please note that your implementation should also demonstrate the support for UUID, Date and BLOB data types. It is preferable that you use annotations (as opposed to XML based mapping) as was done in the Lab III. 

In addition to demonstrating creation, update and delete of instances, also show how queries such as "find all services of customer named Jill" and "Find all schedules of  employee named John" are expressed when hibernate ORM is in use.
